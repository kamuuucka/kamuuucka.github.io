                        <p><i>Swamp Unleashed</i> is an endless runner that takes players through three layers of the
                            Internet. In this game, two players work together to achieve the highest score possible while
                            navigating a variety of obstacles. Players can approach these challenges in several ways: by
                            running around, jumping over, sliding under, or balancing on beams.</p>
                        <p>The game has no definitive endpoint; it continuously speeds up until it becomes unplayable. Along
                            the way, players encounter anonymous creatures at crossroads that offer guidance on whether to
                            go left or right. These creatures can lead players toward more surface-level layers of the
                            Internet or deeper into its darker recesses, illustrating the dangers of online exploration and
                            the potential harm from unexpected sources.</p>
                        <p>With a focus on creating a cooperative experience, <i>Swamp Unleashed</i> emphasizes the
                            importance of working together in a society that often leans towards individualism. Since the
                            game was showcased at a festival, we ensured that it is accessible to players of all ages. While
                            some areas of the game feature creepier elements, we maintained a family-friendly atmosphere by
                            avoiding any graphic content.</p>

                    <p><br>For this project I created a tool that is responsible for generating infinite road for our
                        game. The road is being generated from "road chunks" - already premade parts of the road. We
                        wanted our world to look in a ceertain way, so we could not let the objects spawn completely
                        random. The logic behind it was based on the way that <i><a
                                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/">The Binding of
                                Isaac</a></i> generates its levels.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <p>The generator was created using one script: <i>Road Generator.</i> First thing that can be seen
                        is the description at the top of the script. I included there short description together with
                        two important tips.<br><br> Right below there is a Warning Field. I decided to use the warning
                        mark to make sure that user won't miss this part. It was a manual about how to set up the "road
                        chunks" in the correct way. Otherwise the generator will not spawn the road correctly. If I had
                        more time, I would change it in the way that it wouldn't be necessary. Sadly at the moment of
                        creating the tool, I did not have enough time nor knowledge.<br><br> The SETTINGS section is
                        used to control the generation. Here the user can control how fast will the road chunks
                        disappear after the player passes them, how many "road chunks" should be spawned at once, after
                        how many pieces the generator should spawn a crossroad, and what is the size of the whole map.
                        The size of the map was necessary to make sure that the player never gets too far from the (0,0)
                        position. Unity does not handle it well.<br><br> The ROAD section was the list where the user
                        had to add the "road chunks". Thye could add as many pieces as desired, but had to make sure
                        that the order follows the one described in the manual.

                    <p>An important thing that got requested by the designers was a <i>Debug Mode.</i> They wanted to be
                        able to adjust specific things without going into the code. So I created the Debug
                        section.<br><br> There the user can show the border - important while testing if the generation
                        works properly. <br><br> The second part is called <i>Advanced Settings</i>. Those are the
                        settings that should not be changed if absolutely necessary.</p>
