                    <p> You know how difficult it is to catch up with the Internet? How easily you can get lost and get
                        from a video of a cute cat to the whole theory about how pyramids were built by the aliens? In
                        our game you can experience it.<br><br>
                        Together with your friend run through the 3 layers of the Internet: surface web, deep web and
                        dark web. Help each other to get the highest score possible. Be careful on the crossroads! The
                        anonymous users might try to lead you to the "worse" parts of the online world.<br><br>

                        digital swamp".</p>

                    <p> Sometimes browsers are bugged. Pictures won't open, pages won't refresh, and links won't work.
                        What if instead of this, your browser got infected by actual bugs? After downloading Buggle (not
                        the most secure browser), you have to deal with a lot of bugs.<br><br>
                        In Buggle you play as its typical user - an insect enthusiast who wants to learn about their
                        favourite creatures. Unfortunately, your peaceful browsing gets disturbed by ants and
                        cockroaches, whose only goal is to make your experience miserable.<br><br>

                    <p> Baba Yaga is an enigmatic or ambiguous character from Slavic folklore. In some motifs she is
                        described as a repulsive or ferocious-looking old woman who fries and eats children. In
                        Bulgarian, <i>baba</i> means 'grandmother' or 'old woman'.<br><br>
                        Tow players play as two children who got kidnapped by Baba Yaga. They have to escpae her
                        puzzle-filled house by working together. In this interactive escape room you will find yourself
                        immersed in a Slavic/Balkan environment and, hopefully, escape the Baba Yaga.<br><br>
                        The game requires a laptop and two phones to connect. All the devices need to be connected to the same WiFi network.</p>
